## Formatting
* All closing curly brackets get their own lines. The only exception are empty blocks: If it's an empty block of a function `{}` is used in the line the `{` would be on. If it is another empty block, a simple `;` in its own line is used.

* All opening curly brackets are at the end of a non-empty line

* The indention is done with 4 spaces.

* The function definition header is only on one line, if the function takes at most one argument.

* Typenames are in CamelCase.

* Initializer lists are put on a seperate line, and all their elements but the first get their own line.

* Method and type definitions inside type definitions are seperated by the rest with one empty line at the top and bottom.

* Method and type definitions outside other definitions are seperated by two empty lines.

* Variable definitions outside other definitions are seperated by one empty line or none.

A node based vector image, animation and sound creation tool.

## Formatting
All curly brackets, excluding those that are initializer lists, get their own lines. The only exception are empty blocks: If it's an empty block of a function `{}` is used. If it is another empty block, a simple `;` in its own line is used.

The indention is done with tabs.

The function definition header is only on one line, if the function takes at most one argument.

Typenames are in CamelCase.

Initializer lists are put on a seperate line, and all their elements but the first get their own line.

Method and type definitions inside type definitions are seperated by the rest with one empty line at the top and bottom.

Method and type definitions outside other definitions are seperated by two empty lines.

Variable definitions outside other definitions are seperated by one empty line.
